# [jessewei.dev](https://jessewei.dev)

Made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme. Deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

My [old website](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev_old) was raw HTML/CSS ðŸ’€. This is a nice change of pace.

## Deploy locally

First, [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/).

Then, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules --no-single-branch https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev.git
cd jessewei.dev
hugo server
```

## How I set up this site

See [Overview of Hugo/PaperMod and Setting Up This Site](https://jessewei.dev/posts/setup_site/).

## PaperMod diff

My [PaperMod diff](https://jessewei.dev/posts/papermod_diff/) page shows the changes I made to the PaperMod theme using `diff` output.

It's [automated](scripts/). I describe the setup of the page in the link above.
