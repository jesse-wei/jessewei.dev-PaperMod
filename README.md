# [jessewei.dev](https://jessewei.dev)

Made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

My [old website](https://github.com/jesse-wei/jessewei.dev_old) was raw HTML/CSS ðŸ’€. This is a nice change of pace.

## Deploy locally

First, follow the steps in the [Hugo Quick Start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#prerequisites) guide to install Hugo.

Then, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
cd jessewei.dev
hugo server
```
