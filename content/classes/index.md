You probably discovered this page because I gave you the link. This page is unlinked and unsearchable on my website. And surely no one reads the source code. If you did find it by reading the source code, you're a nerd.

I give the link to people who want my advice as to what classes they should take.

I ask that you not give the link to this page to others without my permission ([ask me](mailto:jessew3102@gmail.com)).

[My transcript](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1w1XW71Ndxe7pt5q3Qcos6JIyZTOlpkYe/view?usp=share_link), if you just want to see my classes and grades, not all my comments.

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|COMP 211: Systems Fundamentals (3)|[Brent Munsell](https://cs.unc.edu/person/brent-munsell/)|A|[Statistics](img/comp211_distribution.jpg). Did not use Vim while taking the class, but I'm addicted to Vim now.|

## 22S (Math BS, CS BS)

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|COMP 311: Computer Organization (3)|[Brent Munsell](https://cs.unc.edu/person/brent-munsell/)|A|[Statistics](img/311_distribution_22s.jpg). [My grades](img/311_grades.pdf). Among my favorite classes!|
|{{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://comp550.cs.unc.edu" data-proofer-ignore>COMP 550: Algorithms and Analysis</a> (3){{< /rawhtml >}}|[John Majikes](https://tarheels.live/johnmajikes/)|A|[My grades](img/550_grades.pdf). Mickey Mouse, completely autograded algorithms class without proofs ðŸ’€. Median grade A-; median final exam grade 95%. Considering how important algorithms is, this is terrible.|
|MATH 548: Combinatorics (3)|[Ivan Cherednik](https://math.unc.edu/faculty-member/cherednik-ivan/)|A|Mickey mouse class. He showed everyone the entire class's grades (with names) in an Excel sheet at least 5 times lmao.|
|STOR 535: Probability for Data Science (3)|[Nicolas Fraiman](https://fraiman.web.unc.edu)|A|[Statistics](img/535_distribution.jpg). [My grades](img/535_grades.pdf). This class satisfies any requirement STOR 435 does. Note from page 3 of my [THT](img/tht.pdf) that STOR 535 counts toward the COMP BS and the MATH BS. Imo, STOR 535 is easier, and the coding assignments, which are easy, seem to replace some of the difficulty in STOR 435. By the way, Nico's [advisor](http://luc.devroye.org) and one of his [viewpoints](http://luc.devroye.org/drugs.html).|

## 22SSI

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|MATH 566: Introduction to Numerical Analysis (3)|[Jingfang Huang](https://huang.web.unc.edu)|A|[Statistics](img/566_distribution.jpg). [My grades](img/566_grades.pdf).|
|TA for [COMP 210](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/teaching/summer-210.html)|[Kaki Ryan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/)|N/A|[My contributions](../teaching/comp210/)|

## 22SSII

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|PHYS 114: General Physics I: for Students of the Life Sciences (4)|Anna Reine|A|[Statistics](img/114_distribution.jpg). [My grades](img/114_grades.pdf). Mickey Mouse class.|
|CHIN 212: Intermediate Written Chinese (3)|Na Fan|A-|[My grades](img/212_grades.pdf). RIP, had no motivation to do work in this course.|
|TA for [COMP 210](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/teaching/summer-210.html)|[Kaki Ryan](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/)|N/A|[My contributions](../teaching/comp210/)|

## 22F

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|{{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://comp421.cs.unc.edu" data-proofer-ignore>COMP 421: Files and Databases</a> (3){{< /rawhtml >}}|[John Majikes](https://tarheels.live/johnmajikes/)|A|[My grades](img/421_grades.pdf). Majikes said he'd drop the lower midterm from day one. M1 was Mickey Mouse (median 85%), so no one cared about M2 (25% of class didn't attend). M2 was difficult but objectively not too bad in hindsight. Majikes won't be dropping midterms anymore. The final was Mickey Mouse, especially because it had 110 points (`grade = min(100, score)`). Overall, second easiest COMP elective after COMP426.|
|[COMP 530: Operating Systems](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f22/) (3)|[Donald Porter](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/)|A|[Statistics](img/530_distribution.pdf). [My grades](img/530_grades.pdf). Hardest assignments in all my CS courses so far. Was beyond fortunate to have two unbelievably strong teammates, [Max Muoto](https://maxmuoto.com) and Madison Lester, by my side. *Plenty* of EC challenges in the labs to make up ground, especially since only ~15% of the class goes for EC, and the class is curved. Be strategic about which EC to do.|
|[COMP 541: Digital Logic and Computer Design](https://comp541.web.unc.edu/) (4)|[Montek Singh](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~montek/)|A|[My grades](img/541_grades.pdf). [My project](../projects/rubiks_541/). Second favorite class at UNC, and Montek is an awesome teacher. 70% of the grade is guaranteed to be 100% or close if you put in the effort, so the tests have to be difficult.|
|MATH 533: Elementary Theory of Numbers (3)|[Alexander Varchenko](https://varchenko.web.unc.edu)|A-|[My grades](img/533_grades.pdf). Most braindead Mickey Mouse math class at UNC. Much easier than MATH 381. Unfortunately, I goofed up on test 2. Should've gotten more sleep.|
|TA for COMP 311|[Brent Munsell](https://cs.unc.edu/person/brent-munsell/)|N/A|[Statistics](img/311_distribution_22f.pdf). [My contributions](../teaching/comp311/).|

## 23S

| Class | Professor | Grade | Comments |
| :---: | :-------: | :---: | :------: |
|[COMP 426: Modern Web Programming](https://github.com/comp426-2023-spring) (3)|[John Martin](https://johndmart.in)|A|Degree mill. You could get the entire class's work done in 8 hours. Everything on his [RMP](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2591820) is true.|
|[COMP 523: Software Engineering Laboratory](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/COMP523-s23/) (4)|[David Stotts](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~stotts/), [Louie Lu](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~louielu/) (coach), [Martin Styner](https://www.med.unc.edu/psych/directory/martin-styner/) (client)|A|My favorite class. [NeuroRuler](../projects/neuroruler/). I want to see the grade distribution so bad.|
|MATH/COMP 662: Scientific Computation II (3)|[Jingfang Huang](https://huang.web.unc.edu)|A|[Statistics](img/662_distribution.pdf). [My grades](img/662_grades.pdf). Mickey Mouse, even though I skipped over MATH 661: Scientific Computation I.|
|[COMP 730: Operating Systems](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp730/s23/) (3)|[Donald Porter](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/)|A|Research-based class. Read papers and do research project (or COMP 630 labs). Madison carried my ass. Don't think I enjoy research very much... [Project grade distribution](img/730_project_distribution.jpg). [My grades](img/730_grades.pdf). Surely everyone got full points on the 75% participation (paper reviews) grade, so the only grade that would matter is the project grade. However, the grade doesn't matter for this sort of class. The research experience and connections do. Unfortunately, I failed at that.|
|Head UTA for COMP 311|[Brent Munsell](https://cs.unc.edu/person/brent-munsell/)|N/A|[Statistics](img/311_distribution_23s.pdf). [SAPsim](../projects/sapsim/). [My contributions](../teaching/comp311/).|
