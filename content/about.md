<p align="center">Hi! I'm Jesse Wei.</p>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

I'm a first-year Master's student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.unc.edu) at [UNC](https://unc.edu).

In 2023, I graduated with highest distinction from UNC with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.

I was a head UTA for COMP311 (23S, 22F). I was a UTA for COMP210 ([22Su](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~kakiryan/teaching/summer-210/team/team.html)) and COMP110 ([22S](https://22s.comp110.com/resources/team.html), [21F](https://21f.comp110.com/resources/team.html), [21S](https://21s.comp110.com/resources/team.html)). For my efforts in COMP311, I won the [Diane Pozefsky Learning Assistant Award](https://cs.unc.edu/about/awards/department-awards/pozefsky-la-award/) in 23S.

I live in [Apex](https://www.apexnc.org), North Carolina. I lived in [Lumberton](https://www.lumbertonnc.gov), North Carolina, for 10 years.

A fun fact about me: I used to speedcube.
