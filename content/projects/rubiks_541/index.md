1900 MIPS assembly instructions running on a SystemVerilog processor built from spit and toothpicks in COMP 541.

Project grade: 100%

>
> Wow!
>
> Performs all moves: rotations, slices etc. Undo as well.
>
> Scrambles using PRNG. Generates 8 scrambles. User can modify them but only that last 8 are saved.
>
> Two hardwire modifications: Random number using hardware LFSR. Timer in Verilog on board — LEDs display information.
>
> Nice features: Status bar shows scrambling pattern. Easter egg — sprites change after you solve it. Accelerometer tilt makes rotations. Sound/Jingle on solve win!
>
> All in all, what a truly wonderful project. Initially I thought it would be a pretty tough one to complete, but you successfully did it. In fact, hit it out of the park! Worthy of extra credit (reported separately).
