[GitHub](https://github.com/madiali/mips-emulator).

Made for simulating [COMP 541](https://comp541.web.unc.edu) (Digital Logic & Computer Design) final projects at UNC.

Runs any MIPS program using the 32 supported MIPS assembly instructions.

Simulates memory-mapped I/O devices, including VGA display, accelerometer, and keyboard.

Made in collaboration with Madison Lester.
