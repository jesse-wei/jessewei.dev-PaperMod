## Course description

This course will teach you how to organize the data used in computer programs so that manipulation of that data can be done efficiently on large problems and large data instances. Rather than learning to use the data structures found in the libraries of programming languages, you will be learning how those libraries are constructed, and why the items that are included in them are there (and why some are excluded).

## My contributions

I was a UTA for the course in Summer 2022.

### Review

I held 6 quiz review sessions throughout the short summer semester.

[Here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12e1sxpIHf1mICBM6xSjnnCluqbAZQcE1cxS9P-yykdk/edit?usp=sharing) is a compilation of my review slides. Links to recordings are included.

### Assessments

I created ~10 in-use quiz questions.

### Normal duties

I held office hours, answered student questions on Piazza, and graded assessments.
