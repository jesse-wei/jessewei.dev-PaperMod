## Course description

Introduces students to programming and data science from a computational perspective. With an emphasis on modern applications in society, students gain experience with problem decomposition, algorithms for data analysis, abstraction design, and ethics in computing. No prior programming experience expected. Foundational concepts include data types, sequences, boolean logic, control flow, functions/methods, classes/objects, input/output, data organization, transformations, and visualizations.

## My contributions

I was a UTA for the course in 22S, 21F, and 21S.

### Git workshop

I created a Git workshop for the COMP110 hackathon Hack110.

* [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EHSeRvvkmLQSM9iJL0GyXE-p_i4bnn7eMuCr-YWPQ_A/edit#slide=id.g121efeeb097_0_0)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/comp110git/git-workshop)

Disclaimer: I did not have much experience with Git and GitHub back then. If I were to remake the slides, I would focus on practical usage (such as making a branch, submitting a PR, resolving merge conflicts, if any, and merging). I would also abstract away details by using GitHub Desktop instead of the terminal.

### Normal duties

I held office hours and graded assessments.
