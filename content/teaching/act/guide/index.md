## Introduction

I created this document in high school because lots of people had asked me about how I studied for the ACT, so I decided to write down what I know. You might’ve heard of tutors with rates of $100, $250, even $500 per hour and textbooks that also cost a small fortune, but you can study as effectively as possible without spending any money. Using the strategies here, I scored a [36 on the ACT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H6aFuEPKvbsZlgWtR2-lMSE_7sr83XcS/view?usp=sharing) on my first try without using any paid resources. I also privately tutored for a while, and you can see my the rest of my website for stuff I’ve written.

The **most important part of this guide** is the

TODO linked official practice tests.

[linked official practice tests](#). My #1 piece of advice throughout the years has been to **do only official (previously administered) tests** and not waste your time on crap (third-party) content. If that’s the only thing you take away from this guide, you’ll have gained ~51% of what it has to offer.

## Study plan

This section describes the high-level study plan you should follow. More specific tips are provided later.

### Test format

You should first familiarze yourself with the test format.

Read this Prepscholar article [^prepscholar_format] for a quick breakdown.

[^prepscholar_format]: [Prepscholar - ACT Format: Expert Guide](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-format-expert-guide)

Since the ACT has such strict time constraints, it's important to know the number of questions per section, time per section, and time per question.

| Section | # Questions | Time |
| :-----: | :---------: | :--: |
|English|75|45 min|
|Math|60|60 min|
|Reading|40|35 min|
|Science|40|35 min|

### Basics

English and Math are **content-oriented**. This means that each question is created to cover specific grammar/math topics that you should've learned from school. If you don't understand the topic(s) that an English/Math question is testing, then you have to guess.

Reading and Science are **skill-oriented**. Certainly Reading can't test you on content of specific books, and Science rarely tests actual science topics [^prepscholar_actual_science]. These sections do not test "topics." Instead, they test you your ability to absorb content and answer questions about it quickly. Another way to put it: all answers to all Reading and Science questions are in the passages and figures.

[^prepscholar_actual_science]: [Prepscholar - The only actual science you have to know for ACT Science](https://blog.prepscholar.com/the-only-actual-science-you-have-to-know-for-act-science)

### Study strategy

Based on the above, there are fundamental differences between how you should prep for English and Math compared to Reading and Science.

#### English and Math

For English and Math, you have to understand the basic concepts before grinding out practice tests. If there's a basic concept you don't understand, you need to learn it.

To figure out which English and Math concepts you don't understand, you should take one or two practice tests. Write down what you missed, and figure out the specific topics you need to learn. If you missed question 3, is it because you didn't understand the topic(s) it was testing? If so, which topic(s)?

I do want to note that it can be hard to figure out which topic is tested. In short, you don't know what you don't know. In that case, Googling the question is often helpful, and if that doesn't work, you should ask someone [^act_discord].

[^act_discord]: [ACT Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/E7pTUQG)

TODO: resources

Then you should learn these concepts. Resources are provided below, and you should spend most of your time learning from these resources.

Once you've learned all or nearly all of the basic concepts, you should have at least a 30. This is only a heuristic. It's up to you whether you think you have a solid understanding of the basic concepts, and if you already do, then you should move on to the next step.

Once you understand the basic concepts, the rest of the points will come from grinding out practice tests to improve at taking the ACT. That is, your focus should no longer be on learning new content, though if you come across something you don't know (which shouldn't happen often at this stage), you should obviously learn it. Your focus at this point should be your test-taking skills: answering questions faster, not making careless mistakes, etc. If you know the concept but still got the question wrong, then why did that happen, and how can you fix it?

#### Reading and Science

TODO: link resources

For Reading and Science, you should read about some high-level strategies that work for other people and figure out what you think would work well for you. Resources are provided below. Then practice those strategies by grinding out practice tests. You should also focus on and improve your test-taking skills during this time.

#### The differences

Notice the differences above. For English and Math, if you don't already have a solid understanding of the basic concepts, then you should spend a lot of time learning those concepts before grinding out practice tests.

For Reading and Science, however, it should only take a small amount of time to learn about some high-level strategies. Then you should immediately start grinding out practice tests.

#### Review mistakes

When I say "grinding out practice tests" above, I don't mean that you should just do a practice test and immediately move on to the next one. After doing a practice test, you should review it thoroughly to learn from your mistakes.

## Topics tested

[^khan_math]: [Khan Academy Math](https://www.khanacademy.org/math)

As mentioned in [Basics](#basics), Reading and Science don't really test specific topics since they're **skill-oriented**, so I mostly omit those rows in the table above. Reading tests your reading comprehension under time pressure, and I consider Science to be Reading part 2, except with data and figures: graphs, charts, tables, etc. It tests reading and data comprehension in the context of scientific passages and figures.

Each Science section does have 1-3 questions that require actual science knowledge that you should have learned from high school science classes. For a review, see the resource in the table above.

## Advice for learning concepts

* If you have questions, you can ask them in the ACT Discord server [^act_discord]. There are plenty of smart people there who are willing to help. You might also consider a private tutor.
* If you can tell that you're seriously struggling with some topic, then you should learn that topic from scratch. Choose a good resource(s), and read everything about that topic. Otherwise, if you have a good baseline of knoweldge, you might want to skim to selectively fill in the gaps. In general, be smart about how you study.
* Keep track of your strengths and weaknesses. You should spend more time on your weaknesses than on your strengths, of course.
* How much time you should spend on studying a particular topic should depend on how often it appears on the exam and how well you understand that topic already.

## Advice for practice tests

Once you have a firm grasp on the basic concepts of English and Math and have some solid strategies for Reading and Science, you should start grinding our practice tests. This is to help you learn the patterns in the test so you can subconsciously “game” the test and so you can recognize trends in the mistakes you make.

TODO you can find links to **official** practice tests below in resources

**Official** means authentic (i.e., previously administered) ACT tests from the ACT company. It is crucial to use only official (not third-party) tests to prepare.

When taking practice tests, you should replicate actual testing conditions. This means that you should set timers during the test and take the whole test at once instead of just taking individual sections. At the start, you can take untimed tests and individual sections to get acclimated, but you should eventually transition to timed full tests.




2. Basics and strategies
    4. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">For English and Math, you should understand the basic concepts before grinding out a lot of practice tests. English and Math are content-oriented. </span>**As such, there are fundamental differences between how you should study for English/Math compared to Reading/Science.
        5. But to figure out which basic English/Math concept(s) you don’t understand, you should take one or two practice tests. Write down what you missed, and figure out the specific topics you need to learn. If you missed question 3, is it because you didn’t understand the topic(s) it was testing? If so, which topic(s)?
    5. Here’s some information about what’s tested in each section.
        6. English
            * [https://blog.prepscholar.com/whats-actually-tested-on-act-english](https://blog.prepscholar.com/whats-actually-tested-on-act-english)
            * The questions are pretty much just grammar rules, inclusion/exclusion of a sentence or paragraph, transitions, organization, and style.
            * You can learn grammar rules from the [Grammarly handbook](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/category/handbook/) (highly recommend) or Erica Meltzer’s _The Complete Guide to ACT English_.
        7. Math
            * [https://blog.prepscholar.com/whats-tested-on-act-math-concepts-subjects-and-skills](https://blog.prepscholar.com/whats-tested-on-act-math-concepts-subjects-and-skills)
            * Mostly algebra 1-3 with a few precalculus topics
            * I recommend learning the concepts you don’t already know using Khan Academy.
            * You can also work through _College Panda’s ACT Math _textbook.
        8. Reading
            * There really aren’t any basic concepts that are tested on ACT Reading. For English and Math, you need to know concrete and specific topics: grammar rules and math concepts. For Reading, you need to be able to read fast and precisely. The only way to get better is to do practice questions and review thoroughly.
        9. Science
            * A common misconception is that ACT Science requires actual science knowledge. There are only 1-3 questions that require actual science knowledge (always surface-level knowledge) per test, and all you need to know is covered in high school. [This link](https://blog.prepscholar.com/the-only-actual-science-you-have-to-know-for-act-science) has a decent list of topics. For all other questions, the science knowledge that you need is provided in the text. ACT Science really is just understanding data, graphs, charts, tables, and words. Think of it as ACT Reading part 2 but with data.
            * You may find _For the Love of ACT Science _useful.
    6. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ACT Reading and Science are mostly about your strategies and ability to understand text and data. They’re not content-oriented like English and Math.</span>**
    7. To determine if you are lacking in the fundamentals, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">take a practice test</span>**, which you can find below under **Resources**, and review the questions you answered incorrectly and struggled with. If you find that you have no idea how to even approach some of the questions and/or get a score of under 25, that’s a sign that you are lacking in the basics.
    8. **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">***(IMPORTANT)***</span>** Based on the questions you missed, write down the topics you don’t understand, and then **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn those specific topics</span>**.
        10. For example, you could note that you struggle with circle geometry in Math and comma rules in English.
        11. If you don’t know the name of the concept you didn’t understand in a specific question, ask about it in the [ACT Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/E7pTUQG) or Google the question. In other words, if you don’t know what you don’t know, ask about it!
    9. How much time you should put into studying a particular topic should depend on how often it comes up on the exam and how well you understand that topic already.
    10. If you can tell from a practice test that you're seriously struggling with some topic, start that topic from scratch and read everything in the textbook/website about that topic. Otherwise, if you have a good baseline of knowledge, selectively fill in the gaps. In general, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">be smart about how you study</span>**.
    11. Keep track of your strengths and weaknesses. You should, of course, spend more time working on your weaknesses than on your strengths.
    12. To learn basic concepts for English and Math, I recommend **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">actively reading and working through</span>** the resources I list below under **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Resources</span>.**
        12. After you’re done with some topic, you should take a practice section or two to reinforce the concepts.
    13. To learn strategies for Reading and Science, do the same thing: read/skim through some ACT textbooks I list below. Reinforce each strategy you learn by doing practice problems immediately afterward. Strategies are useless without practice.
        13. Here, I’ll recommend _The Black Book _specifically, which has a lot of problem explanations and clearly shows the thought processes you need to employ for these problems.
    14. The amount of time and effort you should put into this step depends on where you’re at.**_ If you’re already comfortable with the basics (score of 28+), then you should put more time toward practice tests. Until then, you should put more time toward learning the basics_**.
3. Practice tests
    15. Once you have a firm grasp on the basic concepts of English and Math and have some good strategies for Reading and Science in place, you should start **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">grinding out practice tests</span>**. This is to help you learn the patterns in the test so you can subconsciously “game” the test and so you can recognize trends in the mistakes you make.
    16. You can find a link to **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">official practice tests</span>** below under **Resources**.
        14. “Official” means authentic ACT tests from the ACT company. It is crucial to use only official (and not third-party) tests to prepare.
    17. When doing practice tests, you should simulate actual testing conditions as accurately as possible. This means that you need to set timers during the test and take the whole test at once instead of just taking individual sections (if you’re still learning, you can take individual sections, but you need to practice taking whole tests later to train your stamina).
    18. Even more important than doing problems, however, is **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">reviewing your mistakes</span>** at the end.
    19. For each question you answered incorrectly or had trouble with, first try solving the question again by yourself, and then **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ask yourself 3 questions</span>**:
        15. What mistake did I make?
        16. Why did I make that mistake?
        17. How can I prevent myself from making that mistake in the future?
    20. Write down the questions you missed or had trouble with and the answers you gave to the 3 questions because you’ll be able to look back at them later and discover trends.
    21. Those 3 questions are the **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">most important</span>** part of my study plan - if you’re going for a 35+, you have no room to work with. You need to drill out all of your weaknesses, which is what those 3 questions will help you accomplish.
    22. Answer those questions honestly and thoroughly.
        18. For example, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">don’t simply brush off a careless mistake</span>**; you need to be honest with yourself and realize that you made that careless mistake for a reason. Figure out what that reason is, and don’t let it happen again.
        19. If you brush it off by telling yourself, "It's just a stupid mistake; I won't make it on the actual test," you will make that same mistake on the actual test.
        20. Here’s an example of a math question I missed while studying and the answers I gave to the 3 questions:
        21.

<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png).

![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")

    23. Look for the trends in the mistakes you’re making. Are you misreading? Are you making careless mistakes? Are you rushing? Did you miss an important detail? Did you forget to do something? Once you discover the trends, think about how you can prevent yourself from making those mistakes. You can also ask others about how they prevent those types of mistakes. Remember, all mistakes are fixable if you put in the effort.

TL;DR Take a practice test (go to **Resources** to find out how to get one for free) or two and figure out the names of the topics you do not understand (especially for English and Math). Focus your time on learning those basic concepts instead of “learning the test” because it’ll improve your score faster. When you get to the point of knowing all or almost all of the basic concepts, your score should be at least a 27. At that point, do more practice tests to learn the test (develop speed and consistency and reduce mistakes and learn the test patterns), which will allow you to get a 31+. It’s important to get the basics first - of what use is grinding out a bunch of, say, circle problems if you don’t understand what a circle is?


## SPECIFIC TIPS

If you want more tips, you should read the textbooks that I list below under **Resources**. Also, my English and Math tips can’t help much if you don't already have the basics down, so **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">learn the basics</span>**. Lastly, the strategies that I list are ones that worked for me. Although I believe they are optimal and also work well for most people, there may be better strategies for you.



* General
    * If you have any questions about studying or how to solve a specific question or anything else, I recommend that you join the [ACT Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/E7pTUQG) (Do so only if you’re 13 or older!). A lot of people in the server have really high scores and help out with all sorts of questions (I myself used to help a lot when I was in high school). Alternatively, you can ask questions on the [ACT subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/act).
    * Here’s one of the big secrets to the ACT: **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">There are no hard questions</span>**. Think about what a standardized test is - it’s a test based on standards that are equal across the nation. For example, the ACT cannot test calculus or advanced statistics on the math section because calculus and advanced statistics are not available to everyone. As such, there are no hard problems that you are incapable of figuring out as long as you understand all of the basic concepts, which I gave links to in **The basics**.
        * The reason that the ACT can seem hard even though there are no hard questions is that it has strict time limits and tests basic knowledge, such as precalculus and below for math, in ways you may not be familiar with. I show an example of this in the math section below.
    * Here’s another big secret: Every question and correct answer must be **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">bulletproof</span>**. This means that there must always be one 100% unambiguously correct answer to every question because if there were more than one correct answer or even no correct answer, students would complain to the ACT about their scores, and that’s something that the ACT company can’t have.
        * How can you apply this knowledge? Well, now you know that no matter how much the ACT questions use terms like “most likely” and “best answer,” there is only one correct answer, and all other choices are wrong. If you’re having trouble finding the right answer, look for the hole(s) in the incorrect answers; it’s guaranteed that there are holes in every incorrect answer and no holes in the correct answer.
        * And don’t think like this either: “Well, this answer choice seems alright, but this other answer choice also seems ok.” That’s the wrong way to go about it. One of those is 100% right (assuming that you haven’t eliminated the right answer choice), and the other one is 100% wrong. This is a black-and-white test.
    * One last secret: For all sections (yes, even and especially in ACT Math), you need to **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">read very precisely</span>**. In all sections, there are questions that include words or short phrases that you must consider to answer the question correctly. These important phrases can also be found in the passages. You must learn to read fast enough to meet the strict time constraints but also precisely enough that you don’t glance over important details.
    * If you notice that you’re spending too much time on a single question, skip it because all questions are worth the same. I usually work through about 90% of the questions on my first pass and then answer the rest on my second pass.
    * Since the ACT has such strict time constraints, which is the most difficult part of the test, in my opinion, you need to save time whenever possible, however possible. Bubbling answers efficiently can actually save more time than you would think - it could save up to 3 minutes, and since you’re allowed only 35 minutes for both ACT Reading and ACT Science, that time is incredibly valuable. Doing a question in the test booklet and then bubbling in the answer immediately afterward wastes a lot of time because it requires that you physically move your hand over to the answer form and mentally switch tasks for every question. I find it much more efficient to complete an entire section and bubble all of my answers for that section in at the end of my first pass. Then, I'll do the unfinished questions during my second pass and bubble those in. Of course, you could end up misbubbling, which would also make you misbubble all succeeding answers as well. I prevent this by mentally telling myself, “1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is C…” I’ve taken 8 practice tests and have misbubbled only once, which is a rate of error that even those who use a safer strategy would have trouble accomplishing.
        * If you still find this strategy to be too risky, I recommend a compromise: you can bubble in your answers after completing a page instead of the whole section.
    * Process of elimination is very useful. On most questions, there are one or two <span style="text-decoration:underline;">blatantly</span> incorrect answers. On hard questions in which you have trouble deciding on the correct answer, eliminate those first.
* English
    * ACT English is **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">heavily</span>** based on grammar rules. Learn all the grammar rules on the ACT, and ingrain them into your memory by applying those grammar rules in your daily life, your writing, and in your English classes. You can also improve your grammar by reading formal books and articles that use proper grammar.
        * If you are not satisfied with your English score, you’re in luck! The general consensus is that ACT English is the easiest section to improve on because it seriously is mostly just grammar rules.
        * A good resource for grammar is the [Grammarly handbook](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/category/handbook/).
        * You can also use Erica Meltzer’s _The Complete Guide to ACT English_, which has a really good cheat sheet on page 5. The following tips will be based on her cheat sheet.
    * Conciseness is key. For questions that test conciseness (these are the ones with more wordy answer choices), the correct answer choice is the one with the fewest words that is also grammatically correct.
    * Redundancy is not key. If the answer choice repeats something that was previously stated, it is incorrect.
    * Take context into account. For many questions, the correct answer is decided not only by the sentence the underlined phrase is in, but also the preceding or succeeding sentence.
        * For questions about transitions between paragraphs, read the first few lines of the paragraph that the transition is in and the last few lines of the preceding paragraph.
    * For questions involving transitions in or between sentences, figure out the relationship between the two parts on either side of the transition, and choose the answer choice that exemplifies that relationship.
        * Make sure you understand the meanings of transition words. You can use [this website](https://writing.wisc.edu/handbook/style/transitions/) to learn them.
* Math
    * [Here is my list of advanced ACT math concepts and formulas](https://jessewei.dev/tutoring/assets/equations/equations.pdf).
    * I previously mentioned that there are no hard questions on the ACT; it just has questions involving basic concepts that are tested weirdly. Take a look at this question, for example:
        * I initially thought that this was some weird probability or statistics question that I had no idea how to do. However, I had an important insight: If n is a factor of 90, then the sequence will repeat itself. For example, n=6 causes the following circles to be colored: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, 72, 78, 84, 90, **6, 12, 18… ** Also, 4 isn’t the correct answer because it’s an even number, so only even-numbered circles would be filled in (odd ones would be left out).
        * Thus, the correct answer is 7, which will create a sequence that will eventually hit all the dots. As such, the question is essentially asking, “Which of the following numbers is not a factor of 90 and is an odd number,” which is easy, but you have to jump to that conclusion first. This is not an unsolvable hard question - just one that has a “trick.” And this applies to all the “hard” questions on the ACT.
    * Again, you need to realize that there are no unsolvable questions. For “hard” questions like the previous one (of which there are relatively few anyway), you just need to jump to the correct conclusion and apply the basic concept(s).
    * If your answer is not an answer choice, that means you did something wrong, so you need to go back and look for the mistake.
    * There are lots of math questions in which a single small but important detail in the question completely changes the answer. You should <span style="text-decoration:underline;">underline</span> those small details to ensure that you arrive at the correct answer.
    * Don’t spend too much time on easy questions (questions 1-39). Most of the time, they really are just that easy, and there is no trick. If you take too long on the easy ones, you won’t have enough time for the hard ones.
    * You need to use fast solutions to problems. If you miss a question because you ran out of time, then you probably could’ve gotten it right if you did the previous questions faster. While reviewing a question you took too long to solve, first try finding a fast solution by yourself. If you can’t, you can get help by posting that question in the ACT Discord server or subreddit.
    * For some questions, it may be faster to plug in answer choices instead of solving for the correct answer. Although, the brute force approach is also slower for other questions. You need to develop an intuition for when to do so, which you can accomplish by doing lots of practice problems.
        * You can also plug in your answer to check if it’s correct.
* Reading

        **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to read the passages</span>**

    * Some people advise reading the questions before reading the passages. In my experience, this is a terrible strategy. It wastes a lot of time and does not help much with knowing what to look for.
        * Similarly, do not annotate. It’s okay to write 1-3 words beside some paragraphs to help you remember what they mean, but you simply do not have enough time to write detailed annotations.
    * Since time is so limited in this section, one skill that you need is **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">fast reading</span>**.
        * Read as fast as you can without sacrificing much comprehension.
        * Test this for yourself by seeing how fast you can read while still understanding the gist of the passage and being able to remember where some specific information is.
        * You should spend **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">no more than 2:30</span>** reading a single passage. Preferably, you should read faster than that.
    * Make a mental map of the information found in the passage.
        * This means that after reading, you should know roughly where to find certain bits of information (“mapping” out the information).
        * Some questions do not provide citations, such as “In line [x]” or “In paragraph [x],” so you’ll need to know roughly where to find certain bits of information to answer those questions fast.
        * Don’t just hunt through the passage carelessly to look for an answer. Instead, think logically about where the information should be.
    * Do not absorb every detail - you simply do not have enough time.
        * Just get a general idea of the information in the passage and its organization.
        * You can go back and read the important details later when there are questions on that information. If a citation is given, you need to read that part very, very carefully, by the way. Most details aren’t tested in the questions, so why waste time absorbing everything?
        * If you don’t understand a specific detail during the initial read-through, don’t waste time reading it over and over until you understand it. That detail may not be tested in the questions, so just move on.
    * There are four types of passages: prose fiction, social science, humanities, and science. They are always presented in the same order.
        * Some people understand one type better than the others and do better on those. If that applies to you, you can skip directly to your preferred type of passage and do its questions.
    * Some of the passages are really dry and boring, but you need to pretend that you are genuinely interested in them. This will improve your concentration and comprehension.

        **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to answer the questions</span>**

    * Here’s the other skill you need for ACT Reading: You need to read carefully and precisely and **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">take in all important information without taking in anything else</span>**.
        * This seems simple to do, but we’re always taught in our English classes to infer and look for deeper meanings. Unfortunately, inferences, deeper meanings, and interpretations are often subjective, and since all correct answers must be bulletproof, the only correct answers are objective and do not require inference and digging for deeper meanings.
        * What this means is that you should** <span style="text-decoration:underline;">NOT</span> **use any of your knowledge outside the text to answer questions. This **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">WILL</span> **make you answer questions incorrectly. All the information that you need to answer the question is in the text, and it requires no interpretation.
    * Because all correct answers are objective and bulletproof, they are oftentimes just restatements of what’s already stated in the text.
        * If the question requires no interpretation and outside knowledge, then the correct answer must state something that the passage already states, so the correct answer is usually just a restatement.
    * Since all correct answers are bulletproof, eliminate any answers with even a single wrong or inaccurate detail. Remember, all correct answers are supported by the text.
    * It is a viable strategy to do questions with citations (“In paragraph 1,”  “In lines 12-34,” etc.)  first because those questions require that you go back to the passage. If you do them first, then you’ll be rereading parts of the passage, which may help you answer the other questions. This increases efficiency.
* Science
    * ACT Science is like Where’s Waldo.
        * Where’s Waldo is a game in which you search for a single character named Waldo in a cluttered picture like [this one](https://www.bing.com/th?id=OIP.wCKISiDxA7bHzsR8xmfSwgHaEK&w=296&h=168&c=7&o=5&dpr=1.5&pid=1.7).
    * This perfectly describes ACT Science. Here’s an official ACT Science passage from the [2015-2016 Preparing for the ACT Test booklet](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/360031/ACT-2015-16.pdf):



<p id="gdcalert3" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert4">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


    * As you can see, the passage includes lots of confusing science terms and information. Your job, however, is just to ignore all the distractions and find what the question asks for.
        * Don’t worry about not understanding some of the science terms - the passage provides all the definitions you need.
    * The most important part of ACT Science is knowing what to look for. The questions help with this by using terms such as “In Figure 1,” “Based on study 2,” and “According to the passage,” which tell you where to locate your answer.
    * Primary locators are what you should look at first and tell you roughly where to look for your answer:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<strong>Primary locators</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Explanation</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>“Figure 1,” “Figure 2,” “Table 1,” \
“Table 2,” etc.
   </td>
   <td>Look at the figure with the proper label.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>“Based on the results of study…”
   </td>
   <td>Look at the data given for a particular study.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>“Based on study…”
   </td>
   <td>Your answer could be in the passage or the data.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>“According to the information provided...” “According to the passage...” “Based on the passage...”
   </td>
   <td>Your answer is in the passage.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

    * Secondary locators tell you exactly what your answer (Waldo) is:

<table>
  <tr>
   <td>
<strong>Secondary locators</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Explanation</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Units
   </td>
   <td>e.g. m, s, kg, N
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Scientific terminology
   </td>
   <td>pH, temperature bath, detector - Any science phrase
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>x and y-axes labels
   </td>
   <td>The words to the side of the axes
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Answer choices
   </td>
   <td>Sometimes, the answer choices can give clues to your answer.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>


Source: _For The Love of ACT Science_



    * When doing the questions, you should not go back to the passage without a purpose. Use these locators to determine what your purpose is.
        * Let’s look at an example of this process. Consider the following question from the passage above:



<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image3.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image3.png "image_tooltip")


        * Our primary locator is Figure 1, and our secondary locators are the date August 3 (the x-axis label) and Plot 2 (scientific phrase). Now we need to figure out the rest of the problem.
        * Figure 1’s y-axis is albedo, which the passage defines as the “proportion of the total incoming solar radiation that is reflected from a surface.”
            * When you collect data from a chart/graph/table, **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">ALWAYS</span>** look at units. A number is meaningless without a unit.
        * According to the graph, Plot 2’s albedo was 0.20 on August 3, which means 20% of solar radiation was reflected.
        * Because the question asks, “was NOT reflected,” we can subtract 20% from 100% to get an answer of J. 80%.
    * A piece of advice that I’ve received is that you should skip reading the passages and data and go directly to the questions.
        * This is a reasonable strategy that conserves a lot of time. Since many of the questions have locators, this strategy can certainly be very effective.
        * Personally, I skim the passage really fast to get a very general idea of what’s going on, but that’s my preference.
        * Use the approach that works better for you.
    * Remember: Do not get bogged down by any hard scientific terms, units, or data. All the information that you need is provided in the text, and you need to learn to ignore distractions and focus only on what you need to answer the question.
    * The general consensus is that the conflicting viewpoints passages are difficult. If you think this is true, you should save conflicting viewpoints for last.
* **Writing**
    * I’m not going to give many tips for this section because 1. colleges don’t care much about writing since you’ll already be writing essays for your application (that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t care about it at all because failing it will definitely be counted against you; my rule of thumb is that you should aim for an 8+ for even the most selective schools), 2. I got only a 9/12, which I don’t consider high enough for me to give tips to others, and 3. someone else who scored an 11/12 already wrote up an excellent guide. Here it is: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pGgXi-fEEwbJr0Qdp5OzRkSsWnXr0IklTvFRSiZsCpw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pGgXi-fEEwbJr0Qdp5OzRkSsWnXr0IklTvFRSiZsCpw/edit?usp=sharing)
        * ACT Writing is incredibly formulaic. You will get a good score if you follow the format in that guide (I did) and write at least somewhat well.
    * One tip I will give is that essay length is highly correlated with score, as shown in this graph from [https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-does-act-essay-length-affect-your-score](https://blog.prepscholar.com/how-does-act-essay-length-affect-your-score):



<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png).

![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")




        * However, this could be because people who write more generally are the ones with better ideas, analysis, and writing ability. The correlation is still there, though, so I still believe that writing more is better. I wrote about 2.1 pages, but I think getting to 3 pages is optimal.
    * Lastly, here’s a link to the ACT Writing rubric: [http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/Writing-Test-Scoring-Rubric.pdf](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/Writing-Test-Scoring-Rubric.pdf)
        * Make sure to "engage with the other perspectives."

## FAQ

Q: What did you study, and how long did you study every day?

I studied for the entire month before my test. During the first few days, I completed a diagnostic practice test and created a couple of pages in OneNote to keep track of the scores I got and mistakes I made. My initial practice test score was a composite 33 (35E 35M 30R 33S, if I remember correctly). After that, I spent about 30% of the month reading and taking notes on textbooks for areas I was uncomfortable with - namely, ACT Reading and ACT Science. I first read the _Black Book_ and worked through some of the example problems for Reading and Science listed in the book. Although that book helped a lot, I still was not confident in those sections, so I read _The Complete Guide to ACT Reading _and _For the Love of ACT Science_, taking practice ACT Reading and ACT Science sections after reading each book to practice the strategies and tips I learned from the textbooks. I spent about 3 hours each day reading textbooks.

I spent the rest of the month doing official ACT tests and reviewing weaknesses and mistakes. I completed 7 more practice tests (about 1 test per 2.5 days). At first, I couldn’t do an entire test in one sitting, but I did manage to do so for my last 2 or 3 tests. During this time, I was still struggling with making careless mistakes and not being fast enough, so that’s what I focused on improving.

Q: How should I study?

	Don’t copy my study routine exactly. Different people have different strengths and weaknesses, so it’s up to you to figure out what you need to do. I believe that you should roughly follow my study plan (as outlined in the beginning of this document, you should understand the test, learn the basics, and do practice tests), but since we’re different people, you will need to allocate your time differently than I did. For example, since I was already comfortable with English and Math, I didn’t put effort into those sections. If you struggle with English and Math, however, then you’ll need to put effort into those areas.

	As for how long you should study, the same principle applies. I was already comfortable with the basics, so a month of study was enough for me. If you’re not comfortable with the basics, however, then you’ll need to spend time on learning the basics until you’re confident that you understand them. I would also recommend not studying too much because that’ll lead to burnout, so try not to study for more than 5 hours per day.

	Figure out your needs and develop a study schedule based on those needs.

Q: Can I get [x] score?

	Yes. I believe that any reasonably intelligent person (I think that’s about 95% of students) can get a 33+ with enough efficient study. The ACT really is not an advanced test - it tests only very basic concepts and nothing beyond that. We ACT test takers are very lucky that we don’t have to take the much harder Asian equivalents, such as the Gao Kao (China), CSAT (Korea), the various Indian exams, etc. I believe most people can learn the basics and then practice until they can read the passages and questions quickly and precisely and answer the questions accurately. The only problems are putting in the effort and studying effectively. I can’t help you put in the effort because that’s on you (my advice is to try to find a motivation: college admissions, beating a friend, etc.), but I can help with studying effectively. Don’t half-ass the study process. Don’t just glance over textbooks or watch videos about math while doing something else or do practice problems mindlessly. Instead, take notes on textbooks, ask yourself questions while watching videos and make sure you understand completely, and review your mistakes after doing practice tests. Discover trends in the mistakes you’re making, and figure out a way to ensure that you don’t make those same mistakes again. I am confident that if you study actively for a reasonable amount of time, you can get whatever score you desire.

Q: How do I improve in a specific section?

	I alluded to this in **The Basics** above, but I believe that improving in English/Math is different from improving in Reading/Science. English and Math are content-oriented, meaning you have to know the grammar rules for English and the various math topics (algebra, geometry, trigonometry) for Math. If you don’t know the content that an English or Math question tests, you will have to guess. Reading and science, however, are more approach-oriented. There aren’t really any necessary skills for ACT Reading and ACT Science that most people don’t already have. For ACT Reading, you simply need to be able to read. For ACT Science, you need to know how to work with data/figures, and you also need a little bit of basic science knowledge. The difficulty in Reading and Science is not the content tested; it’s how you **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">approach</span> **the information given in those sections.

	Therefore, to improve in English and Math, you need to learn the content. If you don’t know the grammar rules or the meanings of transitions, learn them using _The Complete Guide to ACT English_. If you don’t know the math topics, learn them using Khan Academy or _College Panda’s ACT Math _textbook. After you have a firm grasp on the basics for English and Math, your score should be around a 30. After that, you just need to do practice problems and improve at other skills, such as managing time and not making careless mistakes.

	To improve in Reading and Science, you need to learn good strategies for both sections. I list some of my own strategies under **Tips** for both of the sections, and you can also find more in the _Black Book_, _Complete Guide to ACT Reading_, and _For the Love of ACT Science_. Afterward, try those strategies on an official practice test or two to see if they work for you. If they do work, continue practicing. Practice (with proper strategies) makes perfect.

Q: I want to improve my composite score as fast as I can. Which sections are the easiest to improve?

	The general consensus is that English and Math are the easiest to improve because they are content-based. Simply learning the basic concepts that you don’t already know will raise your scores in those areas by a lot. Just mastering the basics should get you to around a 30 in both sections.

Q: How do I save time?

	The ACT is not just about being able to answer questions accurately - it’s also about being able to do that within the strict time constraints. I list strategies for saving time under the **Tips **for each section. Try those strategies out on a practice test or two; if they work, continue using them. Eventually, you’ll be able to complete the sections within the time constraints.

Q: Should I take the SAT or ACT or both?

	All universities accept both the SAT and ACT with no preference. Thus, you should choose only one to focus on.

	With regards to choosing between the two tests, read this article: [https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-vs-sat](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-vs-sat). The main properties of the ACT you should consider are the faster pace, a Science section, and a lower proportion of the composite score coming from math (however, this does not necessarily mean that if you’re disproportionately good at math you should take the SAT; that was the case for me, but I’m very confident the ACT was better for me regardless). To be honest, just reasoning about it isn’t of much use, so the best way to know which test you should choose is simply to take an official practice test for both. A while ago, I looked through the article that I linked to above and decided that the SAT was better for me, but I realized that the ACT was actually easier for me after completing a practice test.

	One last thing to consider is the tests are, overall, very similar. Don’t spend too much time or effort deciding on which one is better for you. Pick one and go.

Q: Why are the strategies/approaches for ACT Reading and ACT Science in your guide not working for me?

	In my guide, I list strategies/approaches that work well for me, but they’re not guaranteed to work well for you. There are no universal strategies that work well for everyone. However, some strategies are optimal and work very well for many people, and I do believe that this describes the strategies I listed because I scored well using these strategies, and lots of other people and textbook authors recommend these strategies. I would say that when these strategies are practiced and used correctly, they should work for 90% of people. If you fall in the remaining 10%, it’s probably because you have different strengths and weaknesses, needs, and/or preferences. If you fall in that category, I recommend that you go to the ACT Discord or SAT Discord and ask for alternative strategies or find what works on your own.

Q: How important are my SAT/ACT scores? \
	Your score is just a number that shows how well you can take a certain test and how much knowledge you’ve accumulated from school. It doesn’t define who you are or what you are capable of. This score is ultimately meaningless outside of college admissions, and no one will care about your score after you graduate from high school and get accepted to college (unless you want to work as a tutor). It's important not to think of this score as being more important than it actually is, but it's also important to understand its actual importance. Although ultimately meaningless, these scores carry considerable importance in college admissions. A score falls below your target school’s range of scores (below the 25th percentile) will be a red flag in your college application. A score that’s sufficiently low pretty much denies you entry to that school (for selective schools) unless you have a very good reason for getting that score. A high score, however, will open many doors for you by increasing your college admission chances and can even guarantee you scholarships to some colleges. On the other hand, for really selective colleges, even a 36 won’t guarantee you admission. You should aim to get within your target school’s range of scores (preferably the 75th percentile), and then you should focus on other parts of your college application, such as extracurriculars and essays, both of which become much more important than test scores as soon as you hit that “high enough” score. Generally, a 34+ is good enough for any school.

Q: Is my score good?

	Good/bad is very subjective. If you’re applying to a top 20 university, then a 26 would be considered very bad and, as mentioned before, could bar you admission to that university. If you’re applying to a state university with an average score of 21, however, then a 26 would be very good. If you want to determine whether your score is good or bad, look up your target university’s mid 50% score range (25th percentile score - 75th percentile score) and compare your score to that.

Q: Should I take the Writing (essay) section?

	If the universities you’re applying to require or recommend (hint: if a university says that they “recommend” something, treat it as if they say that they require it) ACT writing, take it. If not, you don’t need to, but I would take it anyway just in case you decide to apply to another university that does require/recommend ACT writing.

If you like the advice I give in this document, share it and my website ([https://jessewei.dev](https://jessewei.dev)) with your friends! It makes me very happy to know that I’m helping people out.
