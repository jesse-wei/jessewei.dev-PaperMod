Before we talk about binary, let's first go over the base-10 decimal system.

## Decimal (base-10)

You might know that we count in base-10, the decimal counting system. What does that mean?

Base-10 means there are 10 symbols that we use to count. These symbols are $\{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\}$.

How does our number system work? For decimal numbers, we have a ones place, a tens place, a hundreds place, and a
thousands place. 1, 10, 100, and 1000 are all powers of 10: $10^0,\\; 10^1,\\; 10^2,\\; 10^3$, respectively. In
this system, 1337 is represented as $(1\times 10^3) + (3\times 10^2) + (3\times 10^1) + (7\times 10^0)$. That is, there is a 1
in the thousands place, a 3 in the hundreds place and in the tens place, and a 7 in the ones place. Decimals are
represented in the same way. 2.1337 is $(2 \times 10 ^ 0) + (1\times10^{-1})+(3\times10^{-2})+(3\times 10^{-3})+(7\times 10^{-4})$.

This is why we carry numbers when
adding. If we do $1337 + 1337$, $(7\times 10^0)+(7\times 10^0)=14=(1\times 10^1)+(4\times 10^0)$, so we can put a 4 in
the ones place and carry the $1$ over to the tens place.

Why is this useful? Consider this question: What is the largest 3-digit integer? Clearly, it's 999, which comes
from putting the greatest symbol into the 3 slots we have. But what if I ask what the largest 8-digit integer
is? You would have to write eight 9's. Surely, there's a simpler, more general way to write the answer?

Consider the number that is 1 greater, which is a 1 followed by 8 zeroes, $1\underbrace{00...0}_{8}$. What is
the value of that number?

â˜£ A very common mistake would be to say the highest place value in $1\underbrace{000...0}_{8}$
is $10^9$ because there are 9 digits. Here, we zero-index (start counting from 0).

**Exercise**: Write out the place values of each digit to make sure you understand how the $1$ has value $1
\times 10^8$.

Then the largest 8-digit integer is $10^8-1=99999999$. Now, you also know that the largest
32-digit
integer is $10^{32}-1$ and so on. Let's see an example of how this is useful.

## Binary (base-2)

You're reading this on a computer right now. Behind the scenes of any computer is code. And code consists of
[variables and variable types](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm), such as
`int`, `float`, and `double`.

Let's focus on `int`. In the C programming language, an `unsigned int` is a 32-bit data type that stores
positive integers and 0. What's the greatest number that can be stored in
an `unsigned int`?

Let's now talk about binary, though you should have a pretty good understanding of it by now. "bi-" means
two, so there are only two symbols in binary: 0 and 1. Here's how we count from $0_{10}$ to $7_{10}$ in
binary: `0`, `1`, `10`, `11`, `100`, `101`, `110`, `111`.

This follows the same pattern as base-10. In base-10, if we see a 9 and add 1 to it, we reset it to 0 and carry over a 1. In binary, we do the same but whenever we see a 1 and add 1 to it since we have only 2 symbols.

Also note that $111_2$ is $(1\times 2^2) + (1\times 2^1) + (1\times 2^0) = 7_{10}$.

$111_2$ is the greatest
3-bit number: does this match up with what we learned before? The greatest 3-bit number should be
$2^3-1=7_{10}$, so it works! Addition and
subtraction work the same way as in
base-10. There's a special trick for binary subtraction called 2's complement. If you're interested in that, read more about it
[here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/two-s-complement).

Then the greatest number that can be stored in an `unsigned int` is $2^{32}-1 = 4294967295_{10}$.

*Proof*. The greatest 32-digit base-2 value is $\underbrace{111...1}_{32}$.

Consider $\underbrace{100...0}_{33}$, the number that is 1 greater.

Its value is $1 \times 2^{32}$, hence $\underbrace{111...1}_{32} = 2^{32} - 1$. $\blacksquare$

## Hexadecimal (base-16)

An alternative representation of $\underbrace{111...1}_{32}$ is `0xFFFFFFFF`. The `0x` prefix indicates {{< rawhtml >}}<a href="https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/hexadecimal/all#:~:text=Hexadecimal%20is%20a%20base%2D16" data-proofer-ignore>hexadecimal</a>{{< /rawhtml >}}, which is a base-16 counting system with symbols `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F]`. Each hex digit represents 4 binary digits because $2^4=16$.

## Application

Why is this [important](https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-01-boeing-787-dreamliner-software-bug.html)?

{{< figure src="img/boeing.jpg" caption="Boeing bug" alt="Boeing bug" align="center">}}

Now you understand why Boeing 787 airplanes have this issue! It's a simple case of integer overflow. Computer
memory is aligned in chunks, and in C and other programming languages, an `unsigned int` is specified
to take up 32 bits or $\frac{32}{8}=4$ bytes, no matter how large or small.

$4294967295_{10} = \underbrace{111...1}_{32}$

takes up the same amount of space as does $1_{10} = \underbrace{000...1}_{32}$.

Why? If memory weren't aligned, such that each number does not have leading zeroes to fill up the allocated 32 bits,
how could you know where one number ends and another begins?

## Overflow

Lastly, what would happen if we were to add 1 to the `unsigned int` $\underbrace{111...1}_{32}$, having just learned that

an `unsigned int` cannot have a 33<sup>rd</sup> bit? The ALU of the computer adds 1, but the 33<sup>rd</sup>
1 is discarded since it doesn't fit, leaving just $\underbrace{000...0}_{32} = 0$, an overflow error. Yikes.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    unsigned int int_max = 0xFFFFFFFF; // F == 1111 == 15 in base-10
    // hence 0xFFFFFFFF is 32 binary bits, all 1's
    printf("%u\n", int_max);
    printf("%u\n", int_max + 1);
}
```
