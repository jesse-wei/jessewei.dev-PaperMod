# Script for building website
# Assumes dependencies are already installed when called
# Dependencies: ansi2html, unzip
# Runs in 3 places: Netlify deployment (Ubuntu container), GitHub Actions (Ubuntu container), and locally (macOS)
# scripts/netlify wraps this script and installs dependencies during Netlify deployment (sudo not allowed)
# ci.yml calls this script and installs most dependencies using sudo apt-get
# Locally, I have all dependencies already so not a concern

# Create papermod_diff pages
chmod +x scripts/diff.py
# diff.py outputs to scripts/PaperMod_diff
./scripts/diff.py

# Move diff.py output to content/ to deploy on site
